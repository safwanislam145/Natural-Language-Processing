## Introduction

The notebook demonstrates various NLP techniques, including text representation, text classification, and text preprocessing. Each section provides a brief explanation of the technique and its applications, followed by code examples.

## Bag of Words

The Bag of Words (BoW) model is a fundamental technique in NLP used to represent text data for machine learning algorithms. It simplifies text by converting it into a numerical format that algorithms can understand, while disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequency.

### Applications:
- Text Classification: Spam detection, sentiment analysis, topic categorization.
- Information Retrieval: Search engines use BoW to index and retrieve documents based on keyword frequency.
- Document Similarity: Measuring how similar two documents are by comparing their word frequency vectors.
- Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features for machine learning models.

## Word Vectors

Word vectors enable algorithms to process text by converting words into numerical form, preserving relationships and meanings. Words with similar meanings or contexts have vectors that are close together in the vector space.

### Why Use Word Vectors in NLP?
- Semantic Understanding: Word vectors capture the meaning of words in context.
- Improved Performance: They enhance machine learning models in tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.
- Handling Sparsity: Unlike Bag of Words models, word vectors are dense representations, reducing dimensionality and computational cost.
- Generalization: Models can generalize better to unseen data by understanding word similarities.

## Regexes

Regular expressions (regexes) are used for pattern matching in text. They are useful for tasks like text validation, searching, and text manipulation.

## Stemming/Lemmatization

### Stemming
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. For example, "jumping", "jumps", and "jumped" are reduced to "jump".

### Lemmatization
Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it reduces words to their base or dictionary form. For example, "better" is reduced to "good".

## Stopword Removal

Stopwords are common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that are often removed from text data to reduce noise and improve the performance of NLP models.

## TextBlob

TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides simple APIs for common NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

## Transformer Architecture

The notebook also includes a section on the Transformer architecture, which is a deep learning model used for tasks like machine translation and text generation.
